# synapse-scripts

Provides a few scripts useful when working with synapse while testing/writing bridges.

E.g. you can run `./pristine` to clear your database and create two users with preset passwords.

Expects your conf dir to be `conf/`, your virtualenv dir to be `env/` and your synapse checkout to be `src/`
